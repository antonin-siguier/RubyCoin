# RubyCoin

# Getting Started

## Installing Ruby

[`rbenv`](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) is recommended.  
Using system Ruby is possible, just make sure you have bundler installed, i.e. `$ gem install bundler`.

## Installing Node

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and NPM are required to use Truffle. You should take a look at Yarn if you're planning to use npm a lot.

```sh
$ npm install -g truffle # yarn global add truffle for yarn users
```

## Getting the repo

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:ghivert/RubyCoin.git
$ cd RubyCoin
$ bundle install
```

## About Truffle

You'll find everything you need on [their website](http://truffleframework.com/).  
You'll need to download [Ganache](http://truffleframework.com/ganache/).

## Launching the frontend

```sh
$ bundle exec inesita server
```

Go to [http://localhost:9292/](http://localhost:9292/)

# You're good to go!
